## Why Parlor?

Your company's AI chat UI sucks. You know it. We know it. Parlor replaces it with something you'll actually want to use.

It connects to **any** OpenAI-compatible endpoint --- your company's internal API, OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, LM Studio, or anything else that speaks the OpenAI protocol. Built to [OWASP ASVS L1](SECURITY.md) standards because your conversations deserve real security, not security theater.

> **One command. No cloud. No telemetry. No compromise.**

```bash
pip install parlor
```

---

## Quick Start

**1. Install**

```bash
pip install parlor
```

**2. Configure** --- create `~/.ai-chat/config.yaml`:

```yaml
ai:
  base_url: "https://your-ai-endpoint/v1"
  api_key: "your-api-key"
  model: "gpt-4"
```

**3. Verify** your connection:

```bash
parlor --test
```

**4. Launch:**

```bash
parlor          # Web UI
parlor chat     # Terminal CLI
```

Your browser opens to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. That's it.

---

## CLI Chat Mode

An agentic terminal REPL --- like Claude Code, but connected to **your own API**. Read files, write code, run commands, search your codebase, all from the terminal. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

```bash
parlor chat                     # Interactive REPL
parlor chat "explain main.py"   # One-shot mode
parlor chat -c                  # Continue last conversation
parlor chat -r <id>             # Resume a specific conversation
parlor chat -p /path/to/project # Set project root
parlor chat --no-tools          # Disable built-in tools
```

### How It Works

1. You type a prompt at the `you>` prompt (or pass one as a CLI argument for one-shot mode)
2. A **thinking spinner** with elapsed timer appears while the AI generates a response
3. When the AI calls tools (file reads, bash commands, etc.), the spinner pauses and tool calls display inline with their arguments and results
4. Once complete, the full response renders as **Rich Markdown** --- syntax-highlighted code blocks, tables, headers, lists, bold/italic, and more
5. A **context footer** shows a color-coded progress bar, token usage, response size, elapsed time, and remaining headroom before auto-compact

The AI runs in an **agentic loop**: it can call tools, inspect results, call more tools, and continue reasoning --- up to 50 iterations per turn by default. This means it can tackle multi-step tasks like "find and fix the bug in auth.py" or "add tests for the user service" autonomously, without you needing to intervene between steps.

### Welcome Banner

On startup, the REPL displays:

```
Parlor CLI - /path/to/your/project
  Model: gpt-4 | Tools: 6 | Instructions: loaded | Branch: main
  Type /help for commands, Ctrl+D to exit
```

- **Model**: The active AI model from your config
- **Tools**: Total count of available tools (built-in + MCP)
- **Instructions**: Whether a `PARLOR.md` file was found and loaded
- **Branch**: Current git branch (auto-detected, shown only inside a git repo)

### Built-in Tools

Six tools ship out of the box (no MCP server required):

| Tool | What it does | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `read_file` | Read file contents with line numbers | `path`, `offset` (1-based start line), `limit` (max lines). Output truncated at 100KB. |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite files. Parent directories created automatically. | `path`, `content`. Returns bytes written. |
| `edit_file` | Exact string replacement. `old_text` must match exactly once (unique) or use `replace_all=true`. | `path`, `old_text`, `new_text`, `replace_all`. |
| `bash` | Run shell commands. Returns stdout, stderr, and exit code. | `command`, `timeout` (default 120s, max 600s). Output truncated at 100KB. |
| `glob_files` | Find files matching a glob pattern. Results sorted by modification time (newest first). | `pattern` (e.g., `**/*.py`), `path` (search root). Max 500 results. |
| `grep` | Regex search across files with context lines and file-type filtering. | `pattern`, `path`, `glob` filter, `context` lines, `case_insensitive`. Max 200 matches, skips files over 5MB. |

All file tools resolve paths relative to the working directory (or accept absolute paths). Every tool returns structured JSON that the AI uses to inform its next action.

### Tool Safety

Two layers of protection prevent accidental damage:

**Destructive command confirmation** --- The following patterns in bash commands trigger an interactive `Proceed? [y/N]` prompt before execution:

`rm`, `rmdir`, `git push --force`, `git push -f`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, `git checkout .`, `drop table`, `drop database`, `truncate`, `> /dev/`, `chmod 777`, `kill -9`

**Path and command blocking** --- Hardcoded blocks that cannot be bypassed:

- **Blocked paths**: `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/sudoers`, and anything under `/proc/`, `/sys/`, `/dev/` (follows symlinks)
- **Blocked commands**: `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd if=/dev/zero`, fork bombs
- **Null byte injection**: Rejected in all paths, commands, and glob patterns

### File References

Reference files and directories directly in your prompt with `@`:

```
you> explain @src/main.py
you> what tests cover @src/auth/
you> compare @old.py and @new.py
you> review @"path with spaces/file.py"
```

| Syntax | What it does |
|---|---|
| `@file.py` | Inlines the full file contents wrapped in `<file path="...">` tags (truncated at 100KB) |
| `@directory/` | Inlines a listing of directory contents wrapped in `<directory>` tags (up to 200 entries, with `/` suffix for subdirectories) |
| `@"quoted path"` | Handles paths containing spaces (single or double quotes) |

Paths are resolved relative to the working directory. Absolute paths are also supported. If a path doesn't exist, the `@reference` is left as-is in the prompt.

### Thinking Spinner

While the AI generates a response, a **Rich Status spinner** (animated dots) displays on stderr with an elapsed timer that updates every second:

```
⠋ Thinking... (3s)
```

When the AI pauses to execute tool calls, the spinner stops and tool call output appears. The spinner resumes when the AI starts generating again. Total elapsed time accumulates across all thinking segments and is reported in the context footer.

### Rich Markdown Rendering

Responses are buffered silently (no streaming flicker), then rendered in full using Rich's Markdown engine. This gives you:

- **Syntax-highlighted code blocks** with language detection
- **Tables**, **headers**, **bold/italic**, **lists**, **blockquotes**
- **Padded layout** with breathing room (2-character indent on both sides)

Output goes to stdout (for piping/redirecting), while chrome (spinner, tool calls, context footer) goes to stderr.

### Context Management

Parlor tracks token usage across the conversation using **tiktoken** (`cl100k_base` encoding) with a character-estimate fallback (1 token per 4 chars) when tiktoken is unavailable:

| Threshold | What happens |
|---|---|
| **80,000 tokens** | Yellow warning: "Use `/compact` to free space" |
| **100,000 tokens** | Auto-compact triggers automatically before the next prompt |
| **128,000 tokens** | Effective context window ceiling |

The **context footer** after each response shows:

```
  [====----------------] 12,340/128,000 tokens (10%) | response: 482 | 3.2s | 87,660 until auto-compact
```

- Progress bar with color coding: **green** (<50%), **yellow** (50-75%), **red** (>75%)
- Current token count / max context window
- Response token count for the current turn
- Total elapsed thinking time
- Remaining tokens until auto-compact fires

### Compact

`/compact` (or auto-compact at 100K tokens) sends the full conversation history to the AI with a summarization prompt. The AI generates a concise summary preserving:

- Key decisions and conclusions
- File paths that were read, written, or edited
- Important code changes and their purpose
- Current task state
- Errors encountered and how they were resolved

Tool call outputs are truncated to 500 characters each in the summary prompt to keep it focused. After compacting, the message history is replaced with a single system message containing the summary. Token savings are reported:

```
  Compacted 47 messages -> 1 messages
  ~32,140 -> ~890 tokens
```

Minimum 4 messages required to compact (prevents compacting a nearly-empty conversation).

### Conversation Management

Every conversation is persisted to SQLite. The REPL provides several ways to navigate them:

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `/new` | Creates a new conversation and clears message history |
| `/last` | Loads the most recent conversation (by creation time) with all its messages |
| `/list` | Shows the 20 most recent conversations with title, message count, and truncated ID |
| `/resume 3` | Resume by list number (from `/list` output) |
| `/resume a1b2c3d4...` | Resume by full conversation ID |

```
Recent conversations:
  1. Fix auth middleware bug (12 msgs) a1b2c3d4...
  2. Add user settings page (8 msgs) e5f6a7b8...
  3. Refactor database layer (23 msgs) c9d0e1f2...
  Use /resume <number> or /resume <id>
```

On startup with `-c`, the most recent conversation is loaded automatically. With `-r <id>`, a specific conversation is loaded.

### Auto-Title Generation

After the first exchange in a new conversation, Parlor sends your prompt to the AI to generate a short, descriptive title. This title appears in `/list`, the web UI sidebar, and is stored in the database. Titles are generated asynchronously and silently --- failures are ignored.

### Model Switching

Switch models mid-session without restarting:

```
you> /model gpt-4-turbo
  Switched to model: gpt-4-turbo

you> /model
  Current model: gpt-4-turbo
  Usage: /model <model_name>
```

The new model applies to all subsequent turns in the current session. The conversation history carries over.

### REPL Commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/new` | Start a new conversation |
| `/last` | Resume the most recent conversation |
| `/list` | Show 20 most recent conversations with message counts |
| `/resume N` | Resume by list number or full conversation ID |
| `/compact` | Summarize and compact message history to free context |
| `/model NAME` | Switch to a different model mid-session (omit NAME to see current) |
| `/tools` | List all available tools (built-in + MCP), sorted alphabetically |
| `/skills` | List available skills with descriptions and source (default/global/project) |
| `/help` | Show all commands, input syntax, and keyboard shortcuts |
| `/quit`, `/exit` | Exit the REPL |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+C` | Clear current input. If input is empty, exit the REPL. During AI generation, cancels the current response. |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit the REPL (EOF) |
| `Alt+Enter` | Insert a newline (multiline input) |
| `Tab` | Autocomplete (see below) |

### Tab Completion

Tab completion works for three categories:

- **Commands**: Type `/` then `Tab` to see all slash commands (`/new`, `/list`, `/compact`, etc.)
- **Skills**: Type `/` then `Tab` to also see skill names (`/commit`, `/review`, `/explain`, and any custom skills)
- **File paths**: Type `@` then `Tab` to browse files and directories from the working directory. Subdirectories show with a `/` suffix. Hidden files (starting with `.`) are excluded. Supports nested path completion (`@src/` then `Tab`).

### Command History

Input history is persisted to `~/.ai-chat/cli_history` using prompt_toolkit's `FileHistory`. Previous commands are available with the up/down arrow keys across sessions.

### One-Shot Mode

Pass a prompt as an argument to run a single turn and exit:

```bash
parlor chat "list all Python files in src/"
parlor chat "explain the auth middleware"
parlor chat -c "now add rate limiting to it"    # Continue last conversation
parlor chat -r a1b2c3d4 "fix the failing test"  # Continue specific conversation
```

One-shot mode creates a conversation in the database (visible in the web UI), generates a title, and exits after the response completes. The AI still has access to all tools and can run multiple agentic iterations --- the "one-shot" refers to a single user turn, not a single AI action.

### Skills

Skills are reusable prompt templates invoked with `/name`. Three ship by default:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/commit` | Runs `git diff`, stages relevant files, creates a conventional commit (`type(scope): description`) |
| `/review` | Reviews `git diff` for bugs, security issues, performance concerns, missing error handling, and missing tests. Returns structured findings with severity levels. |
| `/explain` | Reads referenced code and explains architecture, data flow, components, and design patterns |

**Skill arguments**: Append extra context after the skill name. It gets appended to the skill's prompt template:

```
you> /commit
you> /review just the auth changes
you> /explain @src/services/agent_loop.py focus on the event system
```

**Custom skills**: Add YAML files to `~/.parlor/skills/` (global) or `.parlor/skills/` (per-project):

```yaml
name: test
description: Run tests and fix failures
prompt: |
  Run the test suite. If any tests fail, read the failing test
  and the relevant source code, then fix the issue.
```

```yaml
name: deploy
description: Build and deploy to staging
prompt: |
  1. Run the full test suite
  2. Build the production bundle
  3. Deploy to the staging environment
  4. Verify the deployment is healthy
```

**Precedence**: Project skills (`.parlor/skills/`) override global skills (`~/.parlor/skills/`), which override default built-in skills. Parlor walks up from the working directory to find the nearest `.parlor/skills/` directory, similar to how `PARLOR.md` is discovered.

### Project Instructions (PARLOR.md)

Create a `PARLOR.md` in your project root to inject context into every conversation:

```markdown
# Project: my-app

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7

## Conventions
- All functions must have type hints
- Use conventional commits
- Tests required for all new features
```

**Discovery**: Parlor walks up from the current working directory to find the nearest `PARLOR.md`. A global `~/.parlor/PARLOR.md` applies to all projects. Both are loaded if found --- global instructions come first, then project-specific ones.

**System prompt construction**: The CLI builds a system prompt from three sources, concatenated in this order:

1. Working directory context: `"You are an AI coding assistant working in: /path/to/project"` + tool usage guidance
2. `PARLOR.md` instructions (global + project, if found)
3. The `system_prompt` from `config.yaml`

### Shared Database

CLI and web UI share the same SQLite database (`~/.ai-chat/chat.db`). Conversations created in the terminal show up in the web sidebar, and vice versa. Every user message, assistant response, and tool call is persisted with the same schema used by the web UI.

Titles are auto-generated after the first exchange. Tool calls are stored with their inputs and outputs, so the web UI can render expandable tool call panels for conversations that originated in the CLI.

### Unified Tool Executor

Built-in tools and MCP tools work side by side. When the AI calls a tool:

1. **Built-in tools are checked first** --- if the tool name matches a registered built-in (`read_file`, `write_file`, etc.), it executes locally with no network overhead
2. **MCP tools are checked second** --- if no built-in matches, the call is forwarded to the appropriate MCP server

This means a single conversation can use `read_file` (built-in) and `query_database` (MCP) in the same agentic loop. Use `/tools` to see the full list of available tools from both sources.

### Cross-Platform Support

The CLI works on **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows**:

- Signal handling (Ctrl+C to cancel generation) uses `asyncio.add_signal_handler` on Unix and falls back gracefully on Windows where async signal handlers aren't supported
- Path resolution uses `os.path.realpath` for consistent behavior across platforms
- The prompt toolkit input handles platform-specific terminal differences

### CLI Configuration

Add a `cli:` section to `~/.ai-chat/config.yaml`:

```yaml
cli:
  builtin_tools: true     # Enable built-in file/bash tools (default: true)
  max_tool_iterations: 50 # Max agentic loop iterations per response (default: 50)
```

- **`builtin_tools: false`** disables all six built-in tools. MCP tools (if configured) still work. Same effect as `--no-tools` on the command line.
- **`max_tool_iterations`** caps how many tool-call rounds the AI can make per turn. Set lower for simpler tasks, higher for complex multi-step operations.

MCP servers configured in the same `config.yaml` are available in both CLI and web UI.

## Features

### Conversations

| | |
|---|---|
| **Create, rename, search, delete** | Full conversation lifecycle with double-click rename |
| **Full-text search** | FTS5-powered instant search across all messages and titles |
| **Fork at any message** | Branch a conversation into a new thread from any point |
| **Edit & regenerate** | Edit any user message, all subsequent messages are deleted, AI regenerates from there |
| **Export to Markdown** | One-click download of any conversation as `.md` |
| **Auto-titles** | AI generates a title from your first message |
| **Per-conversation model** | Switch models mid-conversation from the top bar dropdown |
| **Copy between databases** | Duplicate an entire conversation (with messages + tool calls) to another database |

### Projects

Group conversations under projects with **custom system prompts** and **per-project model selection**. Your coding project uses Claude with a developer prompt. Your writing project uses GPT-4 with an editorial voice. Each project is its own world.

- Project-scoped system prompt overrides the global default
- Per-project model override (or "use global default")
- Project-scoped folders --- each project gets its own folder hierarchy
- Deleting a project preserves its conversations (they become unlinked, not deleted)
- "All Conversations" view to see everything across projects

### Organization

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Folders**
- Nested folder hierarchy with unlimited depth
- Add subfolders from the folder context menu
- Collapse/expand state persists to the database
- Depth-based indentation in the sidebar
- Rename and delete (conversations are preserved, not deleted)
- Project-scoped: each project gets its own folder tree

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Tags**
- Color-coded labels on conversations (hex color picker)
- Create tags inline from any conversation's tag dropdown
- Filter the sidebar by tag
- Visual badges with color indicators
- Delete a tag and it's cleanly removed from all conversations

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Shared Databases

Connect **multiple SQLite databases** for team or topic-based separation. Each database is fully independent --- its own conversations, attachments, and history.

- **Visual file browser** with directory navigation for selecting `.db`/`.sqlite`/`.sqlite3` files
- **Copy conversations** between databases (full message + tool call history)
- **Switch databases** from the sidebar --- active database is visually indicated
- Database names: letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores only
- "personal" database always exists and can't be removed
- Paths restricted to your home directory for security

### Rich Rendering

| Format | Support |
|---|---|
| **Markdown** | Full GFM --- tables, lists, blockquotes, strikethrough, task lists |
| **Code blocks** | Syntax highlighting via highlight.js with language label + one-click copy button |
| **LaTeX math** | Inline `$x^2$` / `\(x^2\)` and display `$$\int$$` / `\[\int\]` via KaTeX |
| **Images** | Inline previews for attached images |
| **HTML subset** | `<kbd>`, `<sup>`, `<sub>`, `<dl>`/`<dt>`/`<dd>` via DOMPurify allowlist |

### File Attachments

Drag-and-drop or click to attach. **35+ file types** supported. Up to **10 files per message**, **10 MB each**. Every file is verified with magic-byte detection --- a renamed `.exe` won't sneak through as a `.png`.

| Category | Extensions |
|---|---|
| **Code** | `.py` `.js` `.ts` `.java` `.c` `.cpp` `.h` `.hpp` `.rs` `.go` `.rb` `.php` `.sh` `.bat` `.ps1` `.sql` `.css` |
| **Data** | `.json` `.yaml` `.yml` `.csv` `.xml` `.toml` `.ini` `.cfg` `.log` |
| **Documents** | `.txt` `.md` `.pdf` |
| **Images** | `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.gif` `.webp` |

- Image attachments show inline thumbnails with file size
- Non-image files force-download (never rendered in-browser)
- Filenames are sanitized: path components stripped, special characters replaced

### MCP Tool Integration

Connect **stdio** or **SSE-based** MCP servers. Your AI gains access to external tools --- databases, APIs, file systems, anything with an MCP adapter.

- Tool calls render as **expandable detail panels** --- see input during execution, output + status when complete
- Spinner animation while tools execute
- Connected server count and total tool count shown in sidebar footer
- SSRF protection with DNS resolution and shell metacharacter rejection on tool args

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: "my-tools"
    transport: "stdio"
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@my-org/mcp-tools"]

  - name: "remote-tools"
    transport: "sse"
    url: "https://mcp-server.example.com/sse"
```

### Streaming

Real-time **token-by-token streaming** via Server-Sent Events.

- Markdown and math render live as tokens arrive
- **Raw mode toggle** (eye icon in top bar) --- view unprocessed text during streaming, persists across sessions
- Stop generation mid-response with `Escape` or the stop button
- Animated thinking indicator with pulsing dots while AI processes
- Error messages show inline with a **Retry** button

### Command Palette

**`Cmd+K`** / **`Ctrl+K`** opens a Raycast-style command palette with fuzzy matching.

| Command type | What it does |
|---|---|
| **New Chat** | Create a fresh conversation |
| **Theme: Midnight / Dawn / Aurora / Ember** | Switch themes instantly |
| **Model names** | Switch the current model (all available models listed) |
| **Project names** | Jump to a project |
| **Recent conversations** | Quick-jump to your 10 most recent chats |

Arrow keys to navigate, `Enter` to select, `Escape` to dismiss.

### Web UI Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + K` | Open command palette |
| `Ctrl + Shift + N` | New conversation |
| `Escape` | Stop generation / close palette / close modal |
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Shift + Enter` | Newline in message input |

### Settings UI

Click the gear icon in the sidebar to open the settings modal:

- **Model selector** --- dropdown populated live from your API
- **System prompt editor** --- change at runtime, persists to `config.yaml`
- **Theme picker** --- visual cards showing each theme's color palette
- Changes take effect immediately, no restart needed

---

## Themes

Four built-in themes, each with a distinct visual identity. Switch instantly via settings or command palette (`Cmd+K`).

### Midnight `Default`

Premium tech dark --- think Linear, Raycast, Vercel. Deep navy-charcoal with electric blue accents. Glassmorphic sidebar.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/theme-midnight.png" alt="Midnight Theme" width="800">
</p>

### Dawn `Light`

Warm editorial light --- think Notion in sunlight. Cream backgrounds, soft indigo-violet accents, subtle paper texture.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/theme-dawn.png" alt="Dawn Theme" width="800">
</p>

### Aurora `Showstopper`

Living gradient dark with animated CSS aurora (purple/teal/emerald). Gradient borders, animated input focus rings.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/theme-aurora.png" alt="Aurora Theme" width="800">

### Ember `Cozy`

Warm luxury dark --- amber by firelight. Brown-charcoal backgrounds, rich amber glow on focus states.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/theme-ember.png" alt="Ember Theme" width="800">
</p>

**Visual details:**
- Glassmorphism with `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` on sidebar
- Multi-layered shadows for depth: `0 1px 2px` + `0 4px 12px`
- Micro-animations: sidebar items shift on hover, buttons glow, modals spring in
- Gradient text effect on welcome heading
- Smooth 0.5s cross-fade transition between themes
- Code block copy button fades in on hover
- Theme persists in localStorage across sessions --- no flash on reload

---

## Responsive Design

| Breakpoint | Target | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **1400px+** | Large desktop | Wider messages (900px), expanded sidebar (300px) |
| **769-1399px** | Desktop | Default layout |
| **768-1024px** | Tablet | Compact sidebar (240px), full-width messages |
| **0-767px** | Mobile | Slide-over sidebar with hamburger menu + dark overlay |

Mobile sidebar slides in with `transform` animation. Tap the overlay or hamburger to dismiss.

## Security

Parlor is hardened for use on corporate networks and shared machines. Not a checkbox exercise --- real, layered defense.

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Random session token, HttpOnly cookies, HMAC-SHA256 timing-safe comparison |
| **CSRF** | Per-session tokens validated on all state-changing requests |
| **CSP** | `script-src 'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, no inline scripts |
| **Security Headers** | X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, strict Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy |
| **Database** | Column-allowlisted SQL builder, parameterized queries everywhere, `0600` file permissions, path validation |
| **Input Sanitization** | DOMPurify on all rendered HTML, UUID validation on all IDs, filename sanitization |
| **Rate Limiting** | 120 req/min per IP with LRU eviction |
| **Body Size** | 15 MB max request |
| **CORS** | Locked to configured origin, explicit method/header allowlist |
| **File Safety** | MIME type allowlist + magic-byte verification, path traversal prevention, forced download for non-images |
| **MCP Safety** | SSRF protection with DNS resolution, shell metacharacter rejection in tool args |
| **SRI** | SHA-384 hashes on all vendor scripts |
| **API Surface** | OpenAPI/Swagger docs disabled |
| **CLI Safety** | Destructive command confirmation, path validation blocks `/etc/shadow`, `/proc/`, etc. |

## Data Storage

Everything stays on your machine. Nothing phones home.

```
~/.ai-chat/
  config.yaml          # Configuration          (permissions: 0600)
  chat.db              # SQLite + WAL journal   (permissions: 0600)
  cli_history           # REPL command history
  attachments/         # Files by conversation  (permissions: 0700)
```

The data directory is created with `0700` permissions (owner-only). Database files are created with `0600` permissions. WAL and SHM sidecar files are locked down too.
